      <p>Hi. I'm DarknesGaming, and welcome to my new website. Everything I have, it can be found here.</p>
      <p>Because this is a new website, there really isn't much here. I am still working on stuff, like adding a new logo, adding more pages, and connecting what I've made to this place. As you can tell, it is taking me a long time, since I am sharpening my HTML skills.</p>
      <p>Being able to code HTML and CSS isn't easy, but will become easier for me as I continue to develop this website. In time, I may add more libraries from external sources to make the website look and feel better, but will result in your web browsers taking more time to load the website and the other libraries. That's just something I cannot avoid.</p>
      <p>You can use the navigation bar at the top of the screen to get to my projects, or learn a bit more about me. The "About" button is currently disabled because there is no HTML file ready to go yet. You can view my projects by clicking on the "Projects" button, and you can even follow me on GitHub there.</p>
      <p>As of December 15, I have added the news column to the website. This is accessible across my entire website, and you can learn about what's happening right now. There will be news about my project, and all major news that's currently happening around the world.</p>
      <p>As of January 15, I have removed the news column because it did not look good, wasn't beneficial in any way, and honestly, it wasn't useful on this website. One of these days, I'll actually add something cool to the website, but for now, the website will just look like this.</p>
      <p>As of January 18, I have fixed an issue where viewing this website on a mobile device would cause the footer to take up the entire display. Now this website can be viewed from a mobile device.</p>
