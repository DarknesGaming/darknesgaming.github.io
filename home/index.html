    <p>Hi. I'm DarknesGaming, and welcome to my new website. Everything I have, it can be found here.</p>
    <p>Because this is a new website, there really isn't much here. I am still working on stuff, like adding a new logo, adding more pages, and connecting what I've made to this place.</p>
    <p>Being able to code HTML and CSS isn't easy, but will become easier for me as I continue to develop this website.</p>
    <p>You can use the navigation bar at the top of the screen to get to my projects, or learn a bit more about me. Unfortunately, the HTML documents for those are unavailable at this time, so the buttons won't do much but add a "#" to the address bar. Don't try to spam click it, thinking it will get you somewhere. All you'll do is wear out the buttons on your mouse faster.</p>
