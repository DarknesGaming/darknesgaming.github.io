     <h1>Windows or Linux: Which is right for you?</h1>
     <h4>Last edited: January 14, 2017</h4>
     <p>Hello, fellow humans of the internet. If you're reading this, chances are you're trying to decide on which operating system you want to use, and you're choosing between Windows and Linux. There are other websites out there that might be better, but that doesn't mean this HTML document is bad. This document ONLY helps you better choose between Windows and Linux with cold-hard facts, and nothing else.</p>
     <p>Before we begin, we should learn what an operating system is. An operating system is what allows you to use your computer to do what you want it to do. Without an operating system, you wouldn't be able to check your emails, browse the internet, or even be able to read this document right now. Plus, no operating system means a virtually useless computer.</p>
     <p>Now, with that out of the way, let's begin discussing the operating systems you are making a decision on: Windows and Linux.</p>
     <h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
     <p>Almost the entire planet uses Microsoft Windows, the most popular operating system in the world. The only proof you would need for this can be found <a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0">here</a>. Windows has been around for decades, and is being used for many things worldwide. Most computers come pre-installed with Windows, with the exception being Apple computers, since they come with Mac OS X (before <a href="http://www.apple.com/macos/sierra/">macOS 10.12</a> happened). It supports the most amount of programs out there, and is usually the highest pritority when it comes to software develoeprs out there.</p>
     <p>The advantages are obvious. First, there are lots of programs you can install, it is easy to use, and has many useful features you can use, and since it's found in almost all computers, it isn't hard to adjust to using another computer.</p>
     <p>There's a Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education edition. In the Pro edition, a lot more features are enabled (see PCAdvisor <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/feature/windows/windows-10-home-vs-windows-10-pro-uk-difference-3618710/">here</a>. This can be useful, especially when you are using it for your business. I'm not going to get into detail about all the editions here because that's not what the main subject here. You can do research about these editions online.</p>
     <p>The disadvantages might not be obvious to the average consumer, but I'm still listing them. First, you can't stop your computer from updating itself (if you have Windows 10 Home), which can be very annoying. If you had Windows 7 or 8.1, you were eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 10, and Microsoft has been known for upgrading your PC behind your back, and it got so severe, it ended up on the news, and on tech articles like <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3075729/windows/fearing-forced-windows-10-upgrades-users-are-disabling-critical-updates-at-their-own-risk.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3030564/microsoft-windows/microsoft-uses-the-force-you-will-upgrade-to-windows-10.html">here</a>.</p>
     <p>Another disadvantage of Windows can be how easily they can be infected. There are many antivirus systems out there that you can install on Windows, or you can use Windows Defender that comes installed with your computer, and built by Microsoft. The only reason why there are so many antivirus systems out there for Windows is because of how many viruses there are that are specifically designed to attack Windows computers. The popularity of Windows is the main reason why, and there are other reasons as well, which can be found in <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/141944/htg-explains-why-windows-has-the-most-viruses/">this article</a>. With so many viruses out there, it's no wonder companies who make antivirus systems make so much money.</p>
     <p>A third disadvantage would be the PRICE. Microsoft has a reputation for charging people to get a product key for an operating system, and on their Windows Store, it would cost you $119 for the <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100?ICID=Windows_Win10Home_ModE">Home Version</a> and $199 for the <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Pro/productID.319935900?ICID=Windows_Win10Pro_ModE">Pro Version</a>, making this a very expensive operating system. That's how Microsoft makes money, other than their <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>. If you had Windows 7 or 8.1 between July 29, 2015 and July 29, 2016, you could get it for free using a small application they sent through general updates. If you have a Microsoft account, and you actually use it to login to a Windows machine, you can easily <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/131907/how-to-create-and-use-a-recovery-drive-or-system-repair-disc-in-windows-8/">create a recovery disk using a USB Drive </a>and then install Windows through there. Your Microsoft account will already have a digital product key, ready for use on any PC.</p>
     <h3>Linux</h3>
     <p>Now that we got Microsoft Windows out of the way, let's talk about Linux. Linux is harder to talk about, since there are lots of operating systems out there that is Linux. The most popular Linux OS out there is <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, and they are known for being good at their job.</p>
     <p>According to <a href="http://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_unix_gnulinux.htm">this article</a>, Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, and was the first free Unix-like OS out there. There are many companies that use or make operating systems with Linux at its core. Even <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/189036/android-is-based-on-linux-but-what-does-that-mean/">Android is based on Linux</a>, but the kernel was modified for the needs of Android and Google. Linux is also open-source, meaning you could grab the kernel, and make your own operating system out of it, provided that you know what you're doing.</p>
     <p>There are a bunch of advantages to Linux. First, it's much more secure than Windows, since Linux isn't popular, and that can be used as a reason to why there aren't many viruses out there that can infect a Linux computer. That doesn't mean you're 100% secure, so you still have to be careful when surfing the web.</p>
     <p>Another advantage would be the price, because for most Linux operating systems, there isn't a price tag on them. Most are free, but some Linux distributions require you to pay if you want advanced features, or the operating system itself. It has many uses, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/top-10-uses-for-linux-even-if-your-main-pc-runs-window-1513172815">Lifehacker explains some of its top uses</a> on their own website.</p>
     <p>A third advantage would be how small the operating system is. The popular systems out there are usually around 1 or 2 GB in size, compared to Windows, which is over 8 GB. <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a>, however, is less than 1 GB in size, and has seriously low hardware requirements, which means you can breathe in new life to your old PC if they can't run Windows well or the best Linux distributions at top speed.</p>
     <p>The biggest advantage from all of this is the security. Linux security is a lot stronger than Windows, and the proof is obvious. On Linux distributions, you might be the main user of a computer, but you're still running on low-privilege mode. That means you can't do anything that requires root, and you must put in your password if you try. This prevents unauthorized people from screwing up your PC</p>
     <p>Just from these advantages, it should help explain why many servers use Linux and not Windows. The United States Department of Defense most likely uses Linux, because if they used Windows Server, then hackers would be able to break into their servers and screw around with what they find without having such a hard time.</p>
     <p>There are disadvantages to Linux. First, there aren't a lot of applications that support Linux, including Adobe's popular programs. That means you have to turn to alternative programs that support Linux, and most are usually open-source. This can be bad to Windows users who use a lot of programs that don't work on Linux, but the bright side to this is you can contribute to open-source projects and make them have what you want or need to make them more similar to the programs you use that won't work on Linux.</p>
     <p>Another disadvantage would be the steeper learning curve you have to face. Nobody said that switching from Windows to Linux would be as easy as figuring out what one plus one is. If you want to install anything that isn't in the software center (if the operating system comes with one), you have to install it through the Terminal, which means learning how to do stuff from the command line. If you're one of those people who can't handle the Terminal and don't want to get advanced, stick with Windows.</p>
     <p>This disadvantage only applies to laptops. Linux draws more power than Windows, and that's a very ironic disadvantage because Windows is extremely bloated, and Linux is lightweight. However, you can combat this advantage by installing <a href="http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html">TLP</a>, which is a power management tool that increases battery life. How to install it is in the TLP website, so be sure to check there if you want to install that.</p>
     <p>And just like that, we have listed the advantages and disadvantages for Windows and Linux. That being said, let's list what both operating systems are for which type of people. You should use (or keep using) Windows for these reasons:
     </p>
     <ul style="text-align: justify">
      <li>You are just the average human being doing whatever the average people usually do. It's probably email and stuff. I'm not the average person.</li>
      <li>You are a gamer, and want to be able to play all those awesome games out there using <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/directx-12-what-is-it-and-why-it-matters-to-pc-gamers-1318636">DirectX 12</a>.</li>
      <li>You don't do much programming at all (it is not recommended to do programming on Windows, since you need to install all sorts of compilers and interpreters (like GCC and G++, because you have to build that from source code)).</li>
      <li>You're working for Microsoft.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>You should switch (or keep using) Linux for these reasons:</p>
     <ul style="text-align: justify">
      <li>You want to get a deeper understanding of technology.</li>
      <li>You are a hacker, and want to sharpen your skills, find vulnerabilities and exploit them in various operating systems, or be a black hat hacker and siphon money from bank accounts (Don't do this. You'll get arrested if you get caught). I recommend <a href="http://kali.org">Kali Linux</a>, since that's the #1 operating system for hackers.</li>
      <li>You are a programmer, and you're making applications. Linux is programmer-friendly, since it has whatever you need to start programming EXCEPT for an IDE. You have to find one yourself.</li>
      <li>Your computer can't run Windows very well anymore, and you need to breathe life into it. I suggest <a href="http://lubuntu.net">Lubuntu</a>, since it has extremely LOW hardware requirements.</li>
      <li>You don't want to pay a penny or more on an operating system. Many Linux operating systems are free, but the developers behind it do appreciate donations. That does not affect what you get, by the way.</li>
      <li>You're working for the government, and they assigned you to keep their computers secure because it's full of personal information on their citizens. That includes things that you don't other people to know about.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>You now have your list of stuff that you want to do. If you enjoyed this document, you can go ahead and check out the rest of my website, and if you don't want to, you can always do more research on comparing Windows and Linux.</p>
     <p>Thanks for reading this document, and have fun out there. What you choose can influence what you will become in the future.</p>
